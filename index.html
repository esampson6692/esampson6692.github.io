        <p>My 6:30am alarm that I hated so much woke me up. Normally, I hated waking up so early but today was a exception. I was so excited for my first basketball game of the 2021-2022 season for the Plainview Bears. After I woke up I completed my daily schedule like I always did.I took a shower,brushed my teeth and got ready for  <strong>Game Day!</strong></p><p> I was extremely excited when I got to school. All my classes went smoothly besides my last class, 6th period Math. It went well at first and towards the end of class I began to get extremely nervous, so I just listened to my music and tried to focus on the game. After class I went to the Dekalb County Schools Colliseum or (CC) for short. My game was the first game so me and my teamates got some shots up and then go dressed for our game. I could tell everyone was extremely nervous. We started the game very slow the first quarter. We ended up outplaying them the rest of the game but our slow start came back to bite us and we ended up taking the loss. It was tough for us to lose our first game but we all felt that their was room for improvement all over the floor.<strong>"More Games"</strong> was all I could say.</p>

        <p>For our 2nd game we played Austin High School. We played on a Thursday Afternoon. The great thing about game 2 was that we didn't have school because of Veteran's Day. We had a shootaround erlier that day to get prepared. After the shootaround I went home and took and shower and go dressed for the game. I took a long nap for the 2 1/2 hour drive to Austin. We were the first game. We started off really strong compared to our first game. both teams were going back and forth. We ended up being down 5 points at halftime. We had trouble scoring the second half and when we did score we never could go on a run and get back in the game. We ended up taking our second loss of the season.
